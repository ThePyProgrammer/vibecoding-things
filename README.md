This repo contains a few of my really funny experiments with vibe coding, scaling from game development to (hopefully) more useful stuff.

I'm not super into using AI for coding so this is gonna be an exercise in fooling around with Claude, Antigravity, Codex and whatever else I can get my hands on. I will also document every little thing I make below including **how** I built it / what I built it with.

## The Directory

| Name of App | Tool Used |
|-------------|-----------|
| [Atari Combat](https://vibes.prannay.dev/combat) | Claude Web App (Single Prompt) |
| [Atari Combat in 3D](https://vibes.prannay.dev/combat/3d) | Claude Web App (3x Prompts) |

Hopefully as I do this, I'll learn more about how to vibe code and what the best practices are. Till then, let's just fool around a bit with these tools :)
